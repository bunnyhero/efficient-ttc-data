    If you’re on the platform, the train is paused, and you want to get into the right car to line yourself up properly at your destination’s exit, you can watch the traffic signal at the end of the platform. The train won’t move while it’s red. The train will remain until the signal turns yellow or green. When you see it change, hop into the train using the closest door.

    If you’re switching subways at St. George, line yourself up with the exit at your final destination Station, as the University line St. George Station is directly on top of the Bloor line St. George Station. Each train faces the same direction, so the doors are in the same place.

    If while waiting on the platform, the train going in the opposite direction pulls into the station, you can use it to line yourself up &mdash; the doors of the opposite train will be reversed with the doors of the train going in your direction. e.g., if you want to line yourself up at the 2nd car, 3rd door, you would line yourself up at the 5th car, 2nd door of the opposite train.
    <ul>
        <li>1-1 lines up to 6-4<br />
        (1st car, 1st door of opposite train lines up to the 6th car, 4th door of your train)</li>
        <li>1-2 lines up to 6-3</li>
        <li>1-3 lines up to 6-2</li>
        <li>1-4 lines up to 6-1</li>
        <li>2-1 lines up to 5-4</li>
        <li>2-2 lines up to 5-3</li>

    When providing directions to your home, tell people what car and door they should line themselves up to at the station closest to your home.  e.g., if someone is coming from the west, and you live near Pape Station, tell them to make sure they’re on the 4th car and at the 3rd door when they board the train on the Bloor line.

    Board the train at the exact door you want to exit and sit in a seat close to that door. Sometimes it’s possible to forget that you intended to be at a certain door by the time you get to your destination, so it’s best just to be close to the door you intend on exiting so there’s no need to remember.  As well, sometimes the car is too full to move around, and you won’t be able to get to the best door to exit.

    If you don’t have time to line yourself up to the right car at your originating station because the train is there as soon as you arrive, transfer one car at a time between stations.

    While waiting for the subway train, spend the time by walking on the platform to the best position for when you get off. Either way, you will have to walk that distance, so it’s better to walk while waiting for the train instead of after you get off the train at your destination.

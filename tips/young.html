    When riding with young children, sit at the very back or very front of the train. Turn what might otherwise be a boring commute into a fascinating journey. They love to kneel<sup>*</sup> on the seats, look out the window and watch the train roar through the tunnels.<br />
    <br />
    <sup>*</sup> (they really like to stand on the seats, but if you can, encourage them to kneel to keep the seats clean.)

    Stand behind your small child and over to the side as they walk up stairs and escalators. Stand tall and proud and make it clear to others that this space is for your child and that they will have to go around you.

    Let your children get the transfers, pull the stop request wire, and press the stop request button. They like doing these sort of things.

    When riding with small children, travel at the very front or very back of the train &mdash; whatever car is the furthest from the exit. This way when the train exits, you can take your time knowing your child won’t be stampeded by people rushing behind you.

    Use your young child to your advantage &mdash; often you’ll get offered a seat because you have a child, or you may be able to butt into line because you have a child.

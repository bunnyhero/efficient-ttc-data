    Don’t use the TTC bathrooms. (Editor’s note: exceptions are the new stations &mdash; Downsview and Don Mills don’t seem too bad.)

    Don’t go into the subway tunnels. This used to be done by urban explorers to access places like Lower Bay, but they figured out it wasn’t very smart. Trains, whether they be on their regular routes, or training cars or other cars, use all the tunnels, and a train going at full speed can suck you right out of a hiding spot, pulling you into it and crushing you. You can visit Lower Bay by going on a tour or being part of a film shoot, or vicariously through <a href="http://www.infiltration.org/transit-subway.html">others that have done so in the past</a>.

    When disembarking a train which lets you off near a staircase, beware of those who may be rushing down to catch the train and are not yet within sight of you, thus avoiding a bumpy encounter.  Use the round mirrors in the upper corners of the TTC station to see if anyone’s coming.

    If you have fears about an unstable person pushing you into the path of a moving train, stand at the far end of the platform from where the train enters the station. If this unfortunate event occurs, it will give you an advantage because the train will be near or at a complete stop by the time it reaches you.

    Wait in the DWA area on the subway/RT platforms. It has extra lighting, an intercom connected to the station collector, a closed circuit TV camera, public telephone and bench, and is near where the guard’s car stops on the subway and where the driver’s car stops on the SRT.

    The request stop program is available to women traveling by bus or streetcar between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. and allows them to get off in between regular stops. Requests should be made at least one stop ahead of the desired location.

    Before you get on a bus or train, there are a couple of numbers you may wish to take note of in case you lose something or some other emergency arises. On the front of each bus and train is a small white number on a black background. This is called the run number and is unique for each bus or train route. In addition you can note the car or bus number. If you lose your wallet it makes it easier for transit control if you tell them “I was on run 23 on Dufferin at 7:40 a.m.” or “I was on bus 1234 on Dufferin at 7:40 a.m.” Just saying “I was on the Dufferin bus at 7:40 a.m.” means that transit control has to work a harder to figure out what bus or train you were on and there is less chance of your issue being resolved.

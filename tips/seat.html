    If you get on a crowded 504 or 505 streetcar heading south from Broadview station, stand next to any elderly seated Chinese passenger. Chances are they’ll get off at Gerrard &mdash; and you’ll get a seat.

    Plan your route to get on the subway before it hits the busy stations. For example, if you’re at Queen and Parliament, and you want to travel west on the Bloor subway, you could take the streetcar to Queen Station and go north to Bloor, or you could take the bus north to Castle Frank Station and then go west. By choosing the latter option, you would get on the subway before it hits the busy Yonge-Bloor intersection, and thus secure yourself a seat.

    On a busy streetcar, squeeze through to the back &mdash; even if it’s packed with people, there are often seats still available at the very back.

    During peak times, if crossing over from the Spadina-University line to the Bloor-Danforth line, cross at Spadina if going eastbound (before people get on at St. George) or cross at St. George if going westbound (before people get on at Spadina).  Note that if you cross subway lines at Spadina, you will have to do the long walk between the two.

    If you’re going east from St. George, and you can’t get a seat, not to worry &mdash; most people are going to empty out at Yonge and you’ll definitely be able to grab one after that.

    If you have Proof of Payment (a transfer or pass), you can board the Queen streetcar through the back doors at busy intersections.

    When getting on a bus or streetcar at a crowded stop (e.g., outside a college or at a major intersection), walk back one stop and get a seat before the bulk of the passengers board at the next stop. For example, if taking the 501 Queen streetcar west, walk one stop east to Victoria Street and board there.

    When taking the subway, check the edge-of-platform yellow strip. The train doors usually open where the strip is at its grubbiest. (This doesn’t necessarily work if the platform hasn’t been renovated recently and it’s grubby everywhere.)

    If you have to travel the Yonge subway line during rush hour, consider taking the 97 Yonge bus instead. It takes only slightly longer, but there’s a better chance of getting a seat or at least a place to grab hold.

    To know where the rear door will be when the bus arrives at the station, observe the wear pattern on the yellow curb. Positioned to board quickly, you might get a seat.

    For frequently used routes, figure out what door to stand at when the bus or streetcar pulls into the station. For a bus, you can stand at the front door, to the left of the back door, or to the right of the back door. When the bus empties, one of these doors will free up first. In many cases, sometimes to the right of the back door is the best place to stand, as the back of the bus empties out to the left of the back door, and the majority of the front of the bus empties out the front door, leaving the minority of passengers to empty out the right of the back door.

    During rush hour in the morning, the TTC introduces new trains southbound beginning at St. Clair West station. The result is nearly every other train from St. Clair West is empty. If you’re waiting at St. Clair West, Dupont or Spadina during a weekday morning, and you see a train that’s packed with people, it’s worth the extra few minutes wait for the next train.

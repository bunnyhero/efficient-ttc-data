    Try taking the 85 Sheppard East from Sheppard-Yonge Station instead of the Sheppard subway line. You avoid stairs; if you’re continuing east of Don Mills Station, you already have a seat and avoid the long lineup at Don Mills Station for the bus you’re on, and it’s possible to be dropped off at a stop closer to your destination if it’s between two stations along the Sheppard subway line.

    When you want to get off at the front of the bus, avoid being jerked roughly when the bus stops by leaning forward and at the same time swinging yourself around 90 degrees so that you’re on the steps by the time the bus comes to a halt.

    If no one is on the escalator “stand” side, use it instead of the escalator “walk” side &mdash; even if you plan on walking. This way you can move at your own leisurely pace as there will be no pressure to actually even walk at all.

    If you’re at College Station and you’re going to north of Spadina on the Spadina Line, it’s simpler to go southbound and around Union Station than it is to cross over lines twice.

    Hold your nose when riding the SRT between Midland and Ellesmere. There is a bad smell attributed to several things: a parking lot for garbage trucks, a paper processing factory and a recycling plant.

    When waiting at Yonge Station for the Bloor eastbound train during rush hour, let everyone waiting on the platform get on first, then as you get on last, you will be able to secure a spot in the doorway. This doorway will no longer be used as all stations east of Yonge use the outside platform doors until Warden. You can now get comfortable without getting in anyone’s way.<br />
    <br />
    Securing a doorway this way also works well for other stretches of the subway line:<br />

        <li>Eglinton to Union</li>
        <li>St. George to Islington</li>
        <li>King to Spadina</li>
        <li>St. George to Glencairn</li>
    </ul>

    If you’re stuck in a delay in a relatively quiet time of the day (e.g., late at night), and would like to know what’s holding you up, you can position yourself near the operator’s booth in your car and overhear what’s happening on the intercom.

    If you board a bus that is not making any noise, beware, when the driver starts it up, it might startle you.

    If a bus makes a sharp turn, lean in the opposite direction. You won’t fall over as easily.

    When passengers empty a TTC vehicle, they usually all head in one direction (e.g., towards the subway system) &mdash; wait on the side of the door that’s opposite the direction the passengers are going to avoid being swept up in their rush.

    When waiting for a train at your originating station, wait away from the exit to avoid the oncoming rush of passengers leaving the train. For example, the westbound platform for Dundas West Station has an exit at the far west side of the platform. Most regular users of this station know this, and usually crowd at the front car of the train when leaving downtown. Wait near the east end of the platform to avoid this crowd.

    If you’re standing on the platform waiting for the train and you want to know if it’s near, and if tunnel curves, preventing you from seeing very far, close your eyes and try to feel the wind the train is generating.

    After a delay in service has been cleared, it may be to your benefit to let that first, crowded train pass. There will probably be more room on the second train after service has resumed.

    On any given train, one or two cars may be packed. But that doesn’t necessarily mean the entire train is crowded. Shop around as you develop routines. Try boarding different cars to see if there is more room elsewhere.

    If you have flexibility in your arrival and departure times at work, consider riding outside peak hours &mdash; after 9:30 a.m., before 3:30 p.m. and after 6:30 p.m. weekdays.

    If northbound Yonge trains are completely full, consider boarding the very last car. It often has more space.

    Sit on the subway facing either forward or backward, rather than on the horizontal seats. It’s more comfortable as you don’t get tossed around as much, there’s less strain on the back, and these seats aren’t used as footrests.

    If you’re unlucky enough to live near a station that is open to the outside (Dundas West, Warden, Davisville, etc.) dress warmly in winter. It is even less fun to wait for the train when you are cold.

    Warden station sucks.  It’s cold, ugly and super windy.  Do not move or work near there.

    In the mornings when riding south into St. Clair West Station, if you’re standing up in a crowded subway car, look out the left-hand window towards the centre track just before entering the station. Half the time there will be an empty train sitting there. Get off the train at St. Clair West and wait for the empty train. While it will extend your trip by a few minutes, you will be sitting down and relaxing in a less crowded train for the remainder of your trip. If you ride on other parts of the line, watch for similar situations as transit control short-turns trains elsewhere in the system.

    If you don’t like to walk, consider taking the 97 Yonge bus.  It has more stops along Yonge than the subway system and may drop you closer to your destination.  It runs along Yonge between Front and Steeles.

    When you first pay your fare, grab a transfer. You may not think you need it at the start of your journey, but something may come up en route. Make sure your transfer doesn’t end up as litter.

    For a monthly pass to be worthwhile you have to use it more than two trips every weekday (at least 48 times in a month).  If you are taking a week off (as many do during December) it may not be worth it. On the other hand, even if you don’t get the full value, it’s often worth it for the freedom to get off and on whenever you like and the convenience of not worrying about having enough tokens.

    On Saturdays and Sundays, if you have two adults traveling together, a day pass costs only 10 cents more than four tokens &#8212; the amount two people would use on one return trip. If you take at least one more trip beyond that, you’ve recouped your money and then some. Throw in up to four kids, and save even more.

    In the winter, carry your fare on the inside of your glove for easy access and quick fare payment.

    Use TTC tickets instead of tokens if you find you lose tokens. Tickets fit nicely in your wallet and won’t slide out.

    If you regularly use tickets, carry a few extra tokens just in case you find yourself at an automatic entrance with no ticket collector, or in a very long line at the collector’s booth.

    Carry an unused day pass in your wallet for occasions when you may want to start the day using a day pass (when you know you’re going to use the TTC at least five times that day), but you’re not starting off at a subway station (the only place you can buy a day pass). Be careful how you carry it though &mdash; the day pass numbers can rub off and render it useless.  Fold the pass with the numbers on the inside and ensure the fold creases aren’t through the middle of the numbers.

    If you’re with a buddy who is about to pay $3 to board the bus or streetcar, sell them one of your tickets or tokens for $2.50.

    If you’re considering signing up for the Metropass Discount Plan (MDP), but you’re not 100% sure you’d need one every month, consider signing up anyway. You can cancel the plan midway through the term and you’ll only have to pay the difference between the MDP price and the regular Metropass price (i.e., what you would have ended up paying for a Metropass had you never signed up to the MDP).

    Make sure you take a transfer if riding the Queen streetcar. The Queen 501 uses a Proof-of-Payment honour system (allows people who have already paid and are holding a transfer or pass to enter through the streetcar’s back doors) and you may be asked by TTC staff to prove you’ve paid.

    If you forgot your transfer at your originating subway station, grab a transfer at your transfer point and explain to the bus or streetcar driver what happened. They will usually let you on, especially if you look like you are about to cry.

    On the 512 St. Clair streetcar route, a transfer allows unlimited travel for 2 hours. So, if you live on St. Clair Avenue, you can go shopping on St. Clair Avenue, take your stuff home, and then go downtown all for a single fare.

    If you’ve forgotten to grab a transfer and need to one complete your trip, get off at any station en route (except for the destination station), and grab a transfer.<br />

    Bonus efficiency tip: If you’re lined up near the exits for Dundas Station (best position 2nd car, 4th door southbound or 5th car, 3rd door northbound) and your trip takes you past Dundas Station, then you can get off and quickly grab a transfer from a machine located on the same platform as the train. If you’re fast enough, you can reboard the same train and continue on your journey without delay.

    Students and seniors can pick up plastic Metropass holders from fare collectors at subway stations. They will hold your pass and id, and make them easy to flash to drivers as you board the TTC.

    Buy a plastic token holder to easily carry your tokens &mdash; they are hard to find, but sometimes available at dollar stores. (Editor’s note: please email <a href="mailto:sean@ttcrider.ca">sean@ttcrider.ca</a> if you know a place that sells token holders.)

    If you’re considering buying a monthly pass, but you’re not sure, try a weekly pass instead. This will give you the feel of a monthly pass, without the investment. It can be a different mindset taking the TTC when you have unlimited travel and convenient access versus paying for each trip.

    Use TTC fare as currency. For example, if you have dinner with a friend, and you end up paying for most of the meal because your friend only has big bills, you can ask them to pay you back in TTC fare (each ticket/token is worth $2.50).

    If you enter the wrong platform at Dundas, the only way to get to the other platform is to exit the fare-paid area. All you have to do is obtain a transfer and show it to the booth collector at the other platform. They will let you in without paying another fare, as this is a very common mistake.

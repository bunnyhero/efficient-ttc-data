    When you first pay your fare, grab a transfer. You may not think you need it at the start of your journey, but something may come up en route. Make sure your transfer doesn’t end up as litter.

    In the winter, carry your fare on the inside of your glove for easy access and quick fare payment.

    Carry an unused day pass in your wallet for occasions when you may want to start the day using a day pass (when you know you’re going to use the TTC at least five times that day), but you’re not starting off at a subway station (the only place you can buy a day pass). Be careful how you carry it though &mdash; the day pass numbers can rub off and render it useless.  Fold the pass with the numbers on the inside and ensure the fold creases aren’t through the middle of the numbers.

    If you’re considering signing up for the Metropass Discount Plan (MDP), but you’re not 100% sure you’d need one every month, consider signing up anyway. You can cancel the plan midway through the term and you’ll only have to pay the difference between the MDP price and the regular Metropass price (i.e., what you would have ended up paying for a Metropass had you never signed up to the MDP).

    Make sure you take a transfer if riding the Queen streetcar. The Queen 501 uses a Proof-of-Payment honour system (allows people who have already paid and are holding a transfer or pass to enter through the streetcar’s back doors) and you may be asked by TTC staff to prove you’ve paid.

    If you forgot your transfer at your originating subway station, grab a transfer at your transfer point and explain to the bus or streetcar driver what happened. They will usually let you on, especially if you look like you are about to cry.

    On the 512 St. Clair streetcar route, a transfer allows unlimited travel for 2 hours. So, if you live on St. Clair Avenue, you can go shopping on St. Clair Avenue, take your stuff home, and then go downtown all for a single fare.

    If you’ve forgotten to grab a transfer and need to one complete your trip, get off at any station en route (except for the destination station), and grab a transfer.<br />

    Bonus efficiency tip: If you’re lined up near the exits for Dundas Station (best position 2nd car, 4th door southbound or 5th car, 3rd door northbound) and your trip takes you past Dundas Station, then you can get off and quickly grab a transfer from a machine located on the same platform as the train. If you’re fast enough, you can reboard the same train and continue on your journey without delay.

    Students and seniors can pick up plastic Metropass holders from fare collectors at subway stations. They will hold your pass and id, and make them easy to flash to drivers as you board the TTC.

    If you’re considering buying a monthly pass, but you’re not sure, try a weekly pass instead. This will give you the feel of a monthly pass, without the investment. It can be a different mindset taking the TTC when you have unlimited travel and convenient access versus paying for each trip.

    If you enter the wrong platform at Dundas, the only way to get to the other platform is to exit the fare-paid area. All you have to do is obtain a transfer and show it to the booth collector at the other platform. They will let you in without paying another fare, as this is a very common mistake.

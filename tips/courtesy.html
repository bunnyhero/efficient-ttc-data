    When you are sitting on the subway, and someone needs to get by you, stand up and let them by &mdash; do not just turn your knees.

    When giving up your seat to a pregnant or elderly person, directly offer that person the seat as you are getting up. This avoids another person taking the seat you are generously offering.

    When you are on the stairs, and you can see the train pulling into the station is yours, exaggerate your body language to cue those behind you so they know to hurry up. Swing your arms, etc.

    Use the waiting time at bus and streetcar stops to dig out your fare. That way, when everyone is boarding, you won’t have to find it and hold everyone up.

    Place used newspapers in the proper recycling bin. If you want to promote re-use, and the paper is clean, consider putting it back into its original box (if it’s a free newspaper) or into an empty news box (for the free papers) if it’s a paid for paper &#8212; whoever opens it will be pleasantly surprised with a free paid for paper. Don’t leave it on the train as it may end up on the floor.

    Don’t place your cup, water bottle, etc. on the ground of the subway train.  It will fall over within minutes of you leaving and roll around the train for the remainder of the day.  Dispose of it and all other garbage properly.

    Don’t wear perfume, cologne, or other chemical fragrances on the TTC, as many people are allergic to them and you might make them ill.

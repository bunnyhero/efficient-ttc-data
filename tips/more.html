    If you’re looking for something to read on the subway, and you’re lining yourself up at the correct door in order to be closest to your exit escalator, board the car at the door farthest from the door you intend on eventually exiting.  You can then casually stroll through the entire car from one end to the other, along the way picking up the discarded newspapers from the seats that you wish to read for your commute.

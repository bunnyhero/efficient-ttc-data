    Carry something soft (hat, scarf, etc.) in your bag, and when you feel tired, you can put this between your head and the hard window and have a snooze. This is much more comfortable than leaning directly on a window.

    If you want to catch some shut-eye on the train, you can tell when certain stations are coming up by the rumble that the train makes as it passes by a switch, or by the grinding and squealing noise it makes as it rides along a curve. e.g., if youâ€™re traveling westbound on the Bloor-Danforth line, you know Broadview is next by listening for two rumbles followed by a squeal.

    If you are at the front of the first car heading eastbound toward Bay, you can see the entrance to Lower Bay Station. They leave the lights on.

    If you want to see Lower Bay, somehow become involved with a film or commercial shoot down there (e.g., as an extra).

    Taking the Spadina streetcar between Spadina and Union Stations takes you on a tour through some of the most interesting parts of Toronto &mdash; Chinatown, what should be referred to as SkyDome, and Harbourfront &mdash; without you having to pay another fare to continue on your way.

    Standing by the door while going over the viaduct between Castle Frank and Broadview Stations gives you a splendid view of the Don Valley.

    Go on a tour of the Sheppard Subway line &mdash; each Station was designed by a different artist (editor’s favourite: the individually signed Leslie & Sheppard tiles at Leslie Station).

    You are allowed to drink beer on the subway, if the Blue Jays have won the world series that night.

    Memorize all the subway stops in order. Sit in a place where you can see the map and close your eyes. List each stop as you pass them. Open your eyes every now and then to see if you’re correct.

    Play subway trivia games as you travel with friends. e.g., what stations have the word Queen in them; what stations begin with Saint; what station is between Ossington and Bathurst; what’s the only station that begins with the letter F; what letters do no stations begin with?  Make up questions while traveling.

    Visit transit websites and then when you travel, admire the history, quirkiness and beauty of each station:

    The TTC occasionally adds and removes various routes, but they don’t always remove their schedules. On the internet, go to <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/schedules/128N.htm">www.toronto.ca/ttc/schedules/128N.htm</a>, and you will find the schedule for Route 128 Brimley North, a route long gone. Try also <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/schedules/197N.htm">/197N.htm</a> and <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/schedules/171W.htm">/171W.htm</a> for routes 197 Yonge North and 171 Progress East. These routes no longer exist.

    If you’re heading westbound from Warden Station, sit close to the back of the last subway car on a forward-facing seat on the right-hand side of the train. Between Warden and Victoria Park, the train will bend around the track. Look out the window and you will see the front of the train off in the distance. It’s a neat feeling being able to see the front of the train as you’re sitting at the very back. It gives you a sense of how long the trains really are.
